# CourseraMachineLearning
Exercises and notes from the Coursera Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng.

The exercises are done in Haskell. Run `stack build && stack exec CourseraMachineLearning-exe` to execute the exercises.

The "main" function of the project is in `app/Main.hs`. All the "homework" code i.e the code with the functions you are supposed to write as exercises, is in the `src` directory.

There is an IHaskell version of the homework available too. To start it, run `stack build && stack exec jupyter -- notebook`
